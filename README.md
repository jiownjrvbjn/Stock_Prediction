# Stock_Prediction
The goal of this project was to create a website that predicts the stock growth rate on the Indian and USA stock markets. First of all, I used python to create a stock market prediction software and used yahoo finance to collect data on one of the stable stocks in the USA “AAPL”. I then hosted my python model prediction on Streamlit.

Modules Used: 
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler 
numpy 
pandas 
matplotlib.pyplot 
pandas_datareader 
from keras.models import load_model 
streamlit
